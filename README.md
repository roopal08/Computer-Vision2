# CV-Assignment-2 </br>

1. Implement	 the	 DLT (Direct	 Linear	Transformation)	 based	 calibration	C/C++	 or	 Matlab. </br>
2. Implement	 the	 RANSAC	 based	variant	 of	 the	 calibration. </br>	
3. Repeat	 the	 above	 experiments	 after	correcting	 for	 radial	 distortion.	Estimate	 the	 radial	 distortion	parameters	 from	 the	 straight	 lines	in	 the	 image. </br>
4. Use	 the	 real-world	 measurements	that	 are	 provided	 along	 with	 the	estimated	 camera	 parameters	 to	compute	 the	 image	 of	 a	 wireframe	of	 the	 object.	</br>
5. Calibration	of	the	camera	using	 Zhangâ€™s	 method. </br>
6. Select	 a	 camera	 that	 you	 would	 like	to	use	for	the	assignments. Repeat	 the	 3	 calibration	 methods	using	 your	 own	 camera	</br>
